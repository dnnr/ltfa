# This is a regression test for a bug in capgains analysis. Due to the approach
# with cumsum().interpolate().diff() to smoothen out the gains, there is the
# problem of the very first gain being ignored in the returns calculation if it
# also happens to be the very first transaction.

      # into the returns calculation is a bit of a wild card, but it definitely
