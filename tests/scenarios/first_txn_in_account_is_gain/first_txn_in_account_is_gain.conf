# This test ensures the absence of a bug that is likely to be introduced when
# analyzing capgains on a per-account basis. Due to the approach with
# cumsum().interpolate().diff() to smoothen out the gains, there is the problem
# of the very first gain in an account being ignored in the returns calculation
# if it also happens to be the very first transaction in that account.
