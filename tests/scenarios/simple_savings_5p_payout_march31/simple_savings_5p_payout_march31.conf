      # Note: Leap years put a limit on how accurately ltfa is able to
      # back-calculate the return rate unless the payout interval follows along
      # calendar years (i.e., payout on Jan 1). The reason is that when looking
      # at interest payments like in this example on a day-by-day basis, they
      # will be smaller in leap years, since the need to be distributed over
      # one more day. Now if a particular payout falls after February in a leap
      # year (like here, on 2020-03-31), the days falling into the previous
      # year are actually "worth more" than the ones in the leap year. But ltfa
      # cannot really tell this from the balances. Instead, it will "wrongly"
      # assume that all gains between 2019-03-31 and 2020-03-31 are a little
      # bit below what they'd be if 2020 wasn't a leap year. Ultimately, this
      # is unavoidable, but explains why the investment report for this example
      # will not show a perfect 5.00%.

      # Side note: A real bank would probably even pay out a little more (like
      # 15 cents) for 2020-03-31 because the extra day in Februar amounts to
      # more than the "dilution" of the full year's interest by one more day.
      # In other words, 91/366 is greater than 90/365. For all we know, this
      # difference is NOT sufficient to explain ltfa's inaccuracies, not even
      # when compounded. But it does make them worse.
